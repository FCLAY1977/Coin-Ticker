# Coin-Ticker

This is a Coin Price Ticker project that offers a range of Bitcoin-related functionalities. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The HTML code is structured in a way that the website content is contained within the <body> tag and organized into different sections, including Current Bitcoin Price, 
Crypto Value Calculator, Bitcoin Mining, Bitcoin News, and Bitcoin Wallets. The CSS code is designed using a mobile-first approach, 
and media queries are used to extend styles for larger screens. The JavaScript code is responsible for calling an external API to retrieve current Bitcoin prices for various exchanges and updating the table in the Current Bitcoin Price section with the latest information. 
Additionally, the Crypto Value Calculator section provides users with a form to input cryptocurrency abbreviation and price to calculate its value. Finally, the code displays a message in the console when the user clicks on the "Calculate Value" button. 
In order to use the calculator you must first select a cryptocurrency from the dropdown list. The next step is
to enter the amount of the selected cryptocurrency that you own. Finally you can click the "Calculate Value" button to view the current value of your cryptocurrency.
